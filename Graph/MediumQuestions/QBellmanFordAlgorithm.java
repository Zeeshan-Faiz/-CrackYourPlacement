Given a weighted and directed graph of V vertices and E edges, Find the shortest distance of all 
the vertex's from the source vertex S. If a vertices can't be reach from the S then mark the 
distance as 10^8. Note: If the Graph contains a negative cycle then return an array consisting of 
only -1.
