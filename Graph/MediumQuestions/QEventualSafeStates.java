/*
A directed graph of V vertices and E edges is given in the form of an adjacency list adj. Each 
node of the graph is labelled with a distinct integer in the range 0 to V - 1.
A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible 
path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.
You have to return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted 
in ascending order.

Example 1:
Input:
Output:
2 4 5 6
Explanation:
The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no 
outgoing edges from either of them. 
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all 
lead to either node 5 or 6.
