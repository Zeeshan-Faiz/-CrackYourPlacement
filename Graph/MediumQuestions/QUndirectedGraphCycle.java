/*
Given an undirected graph with V vertices labelled from 0 to V-1 and E edges, check whether it 
contains any cycle or not. Graph is in the form of adjacency list where adj[i] contains all the 
nodes ith node is having edge with.

Example 1:
Input:  
V = 5, E = 5
adj = {{1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {1, 3}} 
Output: 1
Explanation: 
1->2->3->4->1 is a cycle.

Example 2:
