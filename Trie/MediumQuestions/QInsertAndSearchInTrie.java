/*
Complete the Insert and Search functions for a Trie Data Structure. 
    Insert: Accepts the Trie's root and a string, modifies the root in-place, and returns nothing.
    Search: Takes the Trie's root and a string, returns true if the string is in the Trie, otherwise false.

Note: To test the correctness of your code, the code-judge will be inserting a list of N strings 
called into the Trie, and then will search for the string key in the Trie. The code-judge will 
generate 1 if the key is present in the Trie, else 0.

Example 1:
