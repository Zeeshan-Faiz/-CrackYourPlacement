/*
Given a Linked List, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:
(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
Each of the sub-linked lists is in sorted order.
Flatten the Link List so all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted 
order.
Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer. Look at the printList() function in the driver code for more clarity.

Example 1:
